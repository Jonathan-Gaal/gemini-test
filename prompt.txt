Rewrite the instruction to make it clear and specific. Consider asking for a few key points to be covered, such as but not limited to:

Definition of climate change
Main causes (e.g., greenhouse gases, human activities)
Observable effects (e.g., rising temperatures, extreme weather events) Potential future impacts
Possible solutions or mitigation strategies
Request the use of simple language suitable for a general audience
Ask for one or two specific examples or statistics to illustrate key points

Tell me about climate change, specifically what it is, it's causes, what observable effects it has on the environment(like temperature changes), and possible solutions
