## Climate Change: A Global Challenge

**What is Climate Change?**

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global weather patterns and temperatures. It's not just about hotter summers or colder winters; it's a complex phenomenon impacting our planet's entire climate system, including oceans, ice sheets, and ecosystems.

**Causes of Climate Change:**

The primary driver of climate change is the **greenhouse effect**, a natural process amplified by human activities. Here's how it works:

* **Greenhouse Gases:** Gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) act like a blanket, trapping heat in the atmosphere.
* **Human Activities:** Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture release significant amounts of these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
* **Enhanced Greenhouse Effect:** This increased concentration of greenhouse gases traps more heat, leading to a gradual warming of the
